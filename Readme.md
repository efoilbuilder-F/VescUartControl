#VescUartControl library

Library for arduino to interface over UART with the Vesc BLDC controler (http://vedder.se/2015/01/vesc-open-source-esc/)
It is used in the ArduBoardControl. Refer here: https://github.com/RollingGecko/ArduBoardControler

#How to use this repository

This is a quick out of the box configuration for an Arduino (I used the Mega 2560 Variant) to communicate with the Vesc via UART. I tested this with VescTool 0.91 and firmware 3.37 on a Vesc 4.12. This should work with at least any VescTool firmware and Vesc 4.12 and 6.x.
